# BinaryOptionsToolsBuilderUI
In this repository we will have the source code for an UI that will allow users to create their own trading strategies without the need to know how to code.


# For those interested in contributing 
We allow anyone that wants to clone the code, add new functions and features and emprove it. But you must follow the following rules:
1. Comment each function, tell at least what the function does, what inputs it expects, and what outputs (ideally in the pull request specify what are the emprovements of the new code)
2. The comments must be in english for anyone to understand
